						<small>Created by <a href="http://hakim.se">Turlough McAnespy</a></small>
					</p>
				</section>



				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>There are a number of overlapping requirements for some upcoming projects that we need to address in a coherent way. These are around the areas of <span class="fragment"><strong>users ability to access the system</strong>,</span> <span class="fragment"><strong>useability</strong></span> <span class="fragment">and <strong>device support,</strong></span> <span class="fragment">but can generally be filed under a broad term of <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</span></p>

					<p class="fragment">It will be a major waste of effort to create only short-term bespoke solutions that we can't re-use on similar projects coming up.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Projects considered</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">CTF Patient Recorded</li>
						<li class="fragment">INPDR Patient Recorded</li>
						<li class="fragment">SMArtCARE Patient Portal</li>
						<li class="fragment">SMArtCARE Physio CTFs +</li>
						<li class="fragment">SaaS Registry</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Accessibility</h2>
					<p>When it comes to the area of Accessibility it will be too onerous to try to deliver a System that delivers the most Accessible experience to all users. 

					<p class="fragment">We need to approach this task as a longer term project and add to the what is there bit by bit, as it is appropriate to do do, while ensuring the foundations are in place from the start.</p>

					<p class="fragment">It also needs to be recognised that making the system more Accessible for one type of user will frequently have benefits for other users.</p>
				</section>

















				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Different Types of problems</h2>

						<p class="fragment">This area is best understood when broken down into a number of smaller areas;</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Useability</li>
							<li class="fragment">Visual impairment</li>
							<li class="fragment">Auditory impairment</li>
							<li class="fragment">Motor impairment</li>
							<li class="fragment">Cognitive impairment</li>
							<li class="fragment">Limitations of Technology</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Useability</h2>				
						<p>Patient Entered Data needs to be as "user friendly" as possible. Health professionals are starved of the systems available to them and will make do with what they get. Patients will not use the systems at all if they find it difficult to work with</p>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Visual impairment</h2>
						<p>There are a number of different areas to consider around visual impairment</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Low vision</li>

							<li class="fragment">Colour blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world</li>

							<li class="fragment">Blindness</li>


						</ul>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Auditory impairment</h2>
						<p>This is not something that affects the system
						</p>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Motor impairment</h2>
						<p>Difficult to use a keyboards or mouse
						</p>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Cognitive impairment</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Learning difficulties (including <a href="https://www.dyslexia.ie/information/computers-and-technology/making-information-accessible-dyslexia-friendly-style-guide/" target="_blank">Dyslexia</a> - estimated that between 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, but this number can also be as high as 17%)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Poor memory (including Dementia)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Photosensitive seizures (including Epilepsy)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Approaches to addressing requirements - abstract</h2>

					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Design approach</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Semantic structure and meaning</li>
							<li class="fragment">Typography and component resizing</li>
							<li class="fragment">Colour contrast (with options)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Responsiveness</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Technology</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Standards-compliant Semantic HTML5 - gives context to screen readers</li>
							<li class="fragment">Aria - a set of attributes to help enhance the semantics of a web site or web application to help assistive technologies, such as screen readers for the blind</li>
							<li class="fragment">HTML5Shiv - The HTML5Shiv is a JavaScript workaround to enable styling of HTML5 elements in versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Useability</h2>

						<p>While it is difficult to verify what constitutes "user friendly" without extensive user testing - it is achieved through focusing on a number of different design attributes;</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Simple</strong>. A user-friendly interface is not overly complex, and provides quick access to common functions.</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>Clean</strong>. A good user interface is well-organized, making it easy to locate options without too much visual noise creating more cognitive load to the user than is necessary.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
	 				<section>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Intuitive</strong>. In order to be user-friendly, an interface must be make sense to the average user and should require minimal explanation for how to use it.</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>Consistant</strong>. By employing popular user patterns that are both consistant within the system and with other popular applications found in the wider digital enviroment, we limit the amount of cognitive dissonance suffers by the user.</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>Reliable</strong>. An unreliable product will cause undue frustration for the user. We ensure that our Patient Registry is reliable and does not malfunction or crash.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

				</section>

 				<section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Design approach</h2>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Semantic structure & meaning</h2>
						<p>Semantic structure and meaning (html) will be independent of the "look and feel" (css style).</p> 

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Use tables for tabular data, not for layout</li>
							<li class="fragment">Use headings correctly to organize the structure of information</li>
							<li class="fragment">Include proper alt text for images</li>
							<li class="fragment">Give your links unique and descriptive names</li>
						</ul>

					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Typography</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Font resizing</strong> - </li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Justified text</strong> - Users with cognitive disabilities can find justified text difficult to read and as a result any/all text is styled to completely avoid this issue.</li>
							<li>Font (Open Sans) optimized for the web and mobile interfaces, with excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Component resizing</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Relative (percentage) widths</strong> should be used instead of absolute units to allow the user to minimize horizontal scrolling while leaving some flexibility with screen magnification</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>Screen Magnifiers</strong> - text will be displayed using actual text rather through images of text.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>


	 				<section>
						<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
						<p>Responsive design is the approach that suggests that design should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.</p>

						<p>The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.</p>

					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Colour contrast (+ options)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Colour blindness</strong> - no important information can be conveyed through the use of colours alone, that may be difficult to percieve by users with color vision deficiency</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>Low Vision</strong> - content must be displayed with a significant amount of colour contrast and generous font & element size, and allow the user to configure as required</li>
						</ul>
					</section>









					<section>
						<h2>Technology</h2>

						<p>Without the use of additional software for addressing accessibility, there is a limit to what is achievable in practice, unless user impairment is relatively mild.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Standards-compliant Semantic HTML5</h2>

						<p>Standards-compliant Semantic HTML5 which is easier to navigate with screen readers, supplemented by ARIA.</p>

						<p class="fragment"><strong>Ensure that all content can be accessed with the keyboard alone in a logical way</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Aria</h2>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Standards-compliant Semantic HTML5</strong> is easier to navigate with screen readers, supplemented by ARIA. We need a (Vue?) ARIA module to provide support for common ARIA attributes that convey state or semantic information about the application for users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</li>

							<li class="fragment"><strong>WAI-ARIA</strong> - Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications is a set of attributes to help enhance the semantics of a web site or web application to help assistive technologies, such as screen readers for the blind, make sense of certain things that are not native to HTML

						<h2>Human User testing</h2>
						<p>The most thorough approach to ensure web accessibility is to test a website with persons with various disabilities to learn what areas are difficult for them to access. As this testing method requires more time and resources, it is best to first undertake the above four types of testing methods to rectify as many web accessibility issues as possible, and then use human testing at later stages of a project to uncover more subtle issues.</p>

						<h2>Clinical Insight Solutions</h2>

						WCAG 2.0 has 3 levels of adherence. 'A' is the easiest to pass but even Angular UI and Bootstrap 3 both fail.

						We have a challenge with the progressive disclosure fields
						Image uploads before saving
						Validation is invoked on page loading not Touch
						Colours - check colour blind (rag)
						Font sizes + Margins - bumping these up could cause issues with the Form layouts and we will see less on screen
						Provide better alt tags
						Require better format on tables
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Useability</h2>

						<p>Cleaned down interface for Patient Portal which allows us to have a much cleaner and lighter UI tailored for devices likely to be used by Patients.</p>

						<p>This should be built from the ground up rather than be version of our standard interface with bits switched off/styled out.</p>

						<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
						<p>What our applications do?</p>
						<p>CFView resizes down to Tablet size with retracting menu.
						<p>Phone app responds to different sizes.</p>
					</section>

	 				<section>
						<h2>Responsive is difficult</h2>
						<p>We need to design and plan better before we code</p>
						<p>We need to accept that elements are flexible</p>

					<h2>Clever Quotes</h2>
					<p>

					<blockquote cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
						&ldquo;For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would
