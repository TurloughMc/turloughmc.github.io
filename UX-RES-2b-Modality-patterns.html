Modal by Reclaiming the screen (resolving master / detail without Modalising everything even on large screens)



How to handle Master / detail on Mobile screens

The challenge we have in this instance is support a Master/Detail for Section within the Patient Record (Meds/Allergies/Problems) and also a Master/Detail of the items within those.

But the truth is we would also need to support the concept the Patient himself/herself also being a Detail from a higher up Master.

The move to Mobile says we can't support more than one of these on the screen at any one time. Mobile first says start here. So what are the options?

0. Master sits above
1. Master sits above - maybe Detail only openning when Master closes and vice versa
2. Carousel as Master / Detail on small items
2. Master sits off screen as Hamburger
3. Master reduces size as an Icon menu
4. Animates in and out from side as interacted with
5. Nest another sub Master list into the active Master item. Click Allergies to see Allergies detail (was summary or list doesn't matter). A sub Master list displays within the active list item
6. 
7. Materialize these and have as many layers as you need - this seems like why Material Design was invented

						<h2>General Definitions</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Dialogue</strong>: “conversation” between the system and the user</li>
							<li><strong>Mode</strong>: A special state of the system in which there is a somewhat different user interface. Each mode may come with different actions</li>
							<li><strong>Overlay</strong>: A content box that is displayed on top of (and is noticeably smaller on a Desktop screen) another page</li>
							<li><strong>Scrim/Lightbox</strong>: A temporary treatment that can be applied to surfaces for the purpose of making content on the surface less prominent</li>
							<li><strong>Modal</strong>: The content on the page is disabled until the user explicitly interacts with the overlay</li>
							<li><strong>Non-modal</strong>: Users can still interact with the background content (eg. clicking links or buttons) while the overlay remains visible</li>

						<h2>When to use Modal Screens</h2>
						<p>In the example above I have suggested the use of a Modal when editing an item but not when you are only viewing the item. Depending on the specific details (gallery items etc.) this may not always be the correct approach.</p>

						<h2>Reclaiming the screen v creating a Modal</h2>

						<p>In Asana the nav is kept til you get to Task (and then Sub Task) and then is dropped for a 'Task' menu.</p>

						<p>In Google Chrome the app was showing a Navigation bar that dissappeared moving from U2 (Navigation bar + Context menu) to War (just Context menu), but I can no longer replicate this functionality and suggests I should have a persistant menu at the bottom (therefore a Tab bar), if I want to use Context menus at the top.</p>

						<p>I need to re-visit Apple docs and the work done with this in mind.</p>

<!-- 						<p>The approach (with Tonys Alopecia demo) used so far has done something a bit different but still largely compatible with what has been documented above. That is to reclaim the screen real estate where there is a significant space available.</p>	 -->

						<h3>Material</h3>

						<ul>

							<li>The Paradigm shift to Material design is only achievable when one sees beyond the 'Popovers are bad' and recognise why they are bad</li> 
							<li>A well designed piece of Material is typically isolating a new layer of UI away from the one underneath not to break the Users focus from the task they were doing but to allow them to focus on a new task or a least a more specific part of the task.

						“[A modal window] creates a mode that disables the main window, but keeps it visible with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application” — Wikipedia
						Most Modal Screens — especially on desktop applications — can be easily identified, because they visually overlay the main window: This is true for popups that fade out the main window in the background, popover menus and popover dialogs, lightboxes, alerts, …
						However, screen estate on mobile devices is limited, which is why many modal screens on mobile devices take up the entire screen. They no longer keep the underlying main window visible and therefore make it harder to distinguish them from Non-Modal Screens

						Minimize the use of modality. Generally, people prefer to interact with apps in nonlinear ways. Consider creating a modal context only when it’s critical to get someone’s attention, when a task must be completed or abandoned to continue using the app, or to save important data. — Apple


						We toyyed with using a supercharged version of Modality as a form of Context resetting. The unusualness of this is anchored in the fact we are building deeper in information architecture than we probably should but if we use Asana typ tabbing this may not be necessary.
