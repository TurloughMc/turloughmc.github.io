						<h3>What is User Centred Design?</h3>

						<p>User-Centered Design can be broken into three main phases: Analysis, Design, Evaluation.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>The Analysis Phase typically includes steps such as:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Vision, goals, objectives</li>
							<li>User analysis</li>
							<li>Task analysis</li>
							<li>Information architecture analysis</li>
							<li>Workflow analysis</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>The Design Phase typically includes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Conceptual/mental model, metaphors, design concepts</li>
							<li>Navigation design</li>
							<li>Storyboards, wireframes</li>
							<li>Detailed design</li>
							<li>Paper or other low-fidelity prototypes</li>
							<li>Medium-fidelity prototypes, for example, online mockups</li>
							<li>Functional, high-fidelity prototypes</li>
						</ul>
					<section>

					</section>
						<h3>Evaluation uses techniques such as:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Design walkthroughs, cognitive walkthroughs</li>
							<li>Heuristic evaluations</li>
							<li>Guidelines reviews</li>
							<li>Usability testing: low fidelity through high fidelity; informal through</li> formal</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>What is Useability?</h3>
					To carry off a conversation about Accessibility requires us to be clear about the difference between Useability and Accessibility.

					(ISO) defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use”
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>What is Accessibility?</h3>

					Using this definition, accessibility focuses on:

					Including people with disabilities as “specified users”
					A wide range of situations, including assistive technologies, as the “specified context of use”


					The distinction between the two is more of a case of creating a category for the "specified users" that exist at the long tail of the bell curve, who require work done which isn't generally useful for the other users.
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Or in otherwords;</h3>

					Usability problems impact all users equally, regardless of ability; that is, a person with a disability is not disadvantaged to a greater extent by usability issues than a person without a disability.

					Accessibility problems decrease access to a website by people with disabilities. When a person with a disability is at a disadvantage relative to a person without a disability, it is an accessibility issue.

					</section>

					<section>

					<h3>Or in otherwords;</h3>

					Put more simply, usability means designing a user interface that is effective, efficient, and satisfying. Accessibility makes sure the user interface is designed to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for more people—especially people with disabilities, in more situations—including with assistive technologies.

					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Or in otherwords;</h3>


					There is no point in investing in Accessibility without first addressing Useability.

					How do we address Useability > User-Centered Design

					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Incorporating Accessibility in User-Centered Design</h3>

					UCD is a process for designing usable products, and user interface accessibility can be approached as a subset of usability.

					It follows then that designers can use ucd to design products that are accessible and in practice accessible design techniques fit well into established ucd processes.

					BUT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN IN A MODULAR WAY, SO THAT MODULES CAN BE ADAPTED WITHOUT CAUSING BREAKAGES IN OTHER MODULES. DEFINITION OF POPULATION IS POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT IN A PRIVATE WORKFORCE THAN FOR A PUBLIC SECTOR PROJECT - HENCE THE MAP MODULE SHOULD BE REMOVABLE WITHOUT BREAKING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Where do Design Thinking and UCD part ways?</h3>
					The point of difference and departure between UCD and DT is also on the difference of their principles of focus. UCD focuses on addressing the whole user experience, hence involving users throughout the design and development is considered primary. While Design thinking focuses on resolving both ill-defined or ‘wicked’ problems primarily, it places greater emphasis on adopting solution-focused strategies and use of abductive reasoning.
