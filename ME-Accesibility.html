						<h3>What is Useability?</h3>
						<p>To carry off a conversation about Accessibility requires us to be clear about the difference between Useability and Accessibility.</p>

						<p>(ISO) defines usability as the <strong>“extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use”</strong>.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What is Accessibility?</h3>

						<p>Using this definition, accessibility focuses on:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Including people with disabilities as “specified users”</li>
							<li>A wide range of situations, including assistive technologies, as the “specified context of use”</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Therefore the distinction between the two is more of a case of creating a category for the a small number of "specified users", who require help which isn't generally useful for the other users.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Or in otherwords;</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Usability problems impact all users equally, regardless of ability; that is, a person with a disability is not disadvantaged to a greater extent by usability issues than a person without a disability</li>

							<li>Accessibility problems decrease access to a website by people with disabilities. When a person with a disability is at a disadvantage relative to a person without a disability, it is an accessibility issue</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Or in otherwords;</h3>

					Put more simply, usability means designing a user interface that is effective, efficient, and satisfying. Accessibility makes sure the user interface is designed to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for more people—especially people with disabilities, in more situations—including with assistive technologies.

					</section> -->

					<section>
						<h3>Incorporating Accessibility in User-Centered Design</h3>

						<p>UCD is a process for designing usable products, and user interface accessibility can be approached as a subset of usability.</p>

						<p>It follows then that designers can use UCS to design products that are accessible and in practice accessible design techniques fit well into established UCD processes.</p>

					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Where do Design Thinking and UCD part ways?</h3>
						<p>The point of difference and departure between UCD and DT is also on the difference of their principles of focus. UCD focuses on addressing the whole user experience, hence involving users throughout the design and development is considered primary. While Design thinking focuses on resolving both ill-defined or ‘wicked’ problems primarily, it places greater emphasis on adopting solution-focused strategies and use of abductive reasoning.</p>
